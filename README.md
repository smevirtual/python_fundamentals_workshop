## Python Fundamentals for Engineers and Manufacturers Workshop

Content and source code for the Python Fundamentals virtual workshop.

Python is useful in many contexts, but this repository is focused on traditional engineering and manufacturing applications
for professionals and students which are new to Python programming.

The future of engineering and manufacturing is clearly becoming more reliant on the exploitation of digital
technologies to reduce costs and to contain quality while product complexity increases exponentially. Machine learning, big data and computational engineering are fast becoming required skill sets for today’s graduating engineer and seasoned professional alike. Computer programming is a fundamental part of these fields and there is no better programming language to start with than Python – with its clear and clean syntax, emphasis on code readability and vast amount reusable libraries.

Please watch the "Setting Up Python on Your Computer" video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKeX7yoPEQ). You will need several pieces of (free) software installed on your computer to fully benefit from the contents of this repository.

### About the SME

The SME is an international organization which seeks to develop engineering and manufacturing talent, promote advanced manufacturing
technology and, ultimately, build a more prosperous tomorrow for the manufacturing community.

Learn more about the SME [here](http://www.sme.org/).

### About the SME Virtual Network

The SME Virtual Network is a volunteer-led online community for SME members, non-members, emerging professionals and students. It was created to engage remote areas that do not have the support of a local SME chapter; busy community members who may not have the time to participate in face-to-face events; and manufacturing professionals who do shift work.

In short, it’s designed to enhance the traditional SME chapter experience. We strive to provide value-added virtual events and engagement opportunities for the manufacturing and engineering community. Post-event discussions will take place SME Connect and an instant messaging platform called Slack.

### Contributing

We accept issues and pull requests!

Keep in mind that this workshop is designed to for Python **beginners** so if you are contributing a Python sample - it should of a similar complexity to the Python scripts already contained within the <a href="https://github.com/smevirtual/python_fundamentals_workshop/tree/master/samples">samples</a> directory. We know that "complexity level" is a little subjective, so we recommend that you open an <a href="https://github.com/smevirtual/python_fundamentals_workshop/issues">issue</a> before implementing your idea so that the community can discuss your proposal. In the future, we will be creating more advanced Python workshops that may be a better fit for your contribution.

If you are teaching this workshop to your chapter or within an SME Virtual Network workshop, please add you name, company and e-mail address to the <a href="https://github.com/smevirtual/python_fundamentals_workshop/blob/master/INSTRUCTORS.md">INSTRUCTORS.md</a> file so that your students can contact you if they need to in the future.

### Feedback

Please open a new <a href="https://github.com/smevirtual/python_fundamentals_workshop/issues">issue</a>.
